# 👋 Hi there, I'm Shaon Biswas!

🚀 **Data Scientist | BI Specialist | AI & MLOps Practitioner**

I am a **Business Intelligence & Data Analytics professional** with over 5 years of experience driving business performance through actionable insights. With dual Master’s degrees in **AI & Data Science** (Distinction) and **International Business Management**, I specialize in bridging the gap between complex algorithms and strategic business decisions.

Currently, I am focused on **Full-Stack Data Science**—moving beyond static notebooks to build deployable, end-to-end AI applications using **Agentic AI** and **MLOps** principles.
